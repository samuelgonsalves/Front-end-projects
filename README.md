# Front-end-projects
Small front-end projects I've been working on...

1. Local Weather App</br>
Detects the current location and displays the weather conditions there.
2. Random Quote Generator</br>
Generates random quotes which can then be posted to Facebook.
3. Wikipedia Viewer</br>
Displays the top 10 articles from Wikipedia based on the query. 
You can also view a random Wiki article.
